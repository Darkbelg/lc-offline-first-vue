# offline-first-notes

This is the source code behind the Laracasts Series: Let's Build an Offline-First Vue App, and features all of the files and code available in those videos.

In the first episode I referenced using the Vue CLI tool. To get started with that, follow the installation instructions [here](https://cli.vuejs.org/guide/installation.html).

## Project setup
```
npm install
```

### Compiles and hot-reloads for development
```
npm run serve
```

### Compiles and minifies for production
```
npm run build
```

### Customize configuration
See [Configuration Reference](https://cli.vuejs.org/config/).
